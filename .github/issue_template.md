I am submitting a...

 - [ ] bug report
 - [ ] feature request
 - [ ] support request => you might also like to ask your question on the [mailing list](mailto:accelerate-haskell@googlegroups.com) or [gitter chat](https://gitter.im/AccelerateHS/Lobby).

## General summary

Do you want to request a feature or report a bug? How has this issue affected you? What are you trying to accomplish with the proposed feature request?

Provide a general summary of the issue (and try to include a descriptive title above).

## Expected behaviour
