Program to run a collection of small examples
---------------------------------------------

This directory contains the source code for building a single,
combined executable (`accelerate-examples`) that can execute many
different tests based on command line flags.

The executable is built by ../../accelerate-examples.cabal.

The subdirectories within this directory are:

 * src-main/  -- The source code for the testing infrastructure itself.
 * src-tests/ -- The test implementations.
